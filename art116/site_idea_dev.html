<p>The site I am designing is one geared toward underwater hockey players. I want it to have two sides, one side designed to get new players started, and the other sided set up to aid players looking to improve their game. I want to include the history, game basics (an overview if you’ve just recently started playing), the equipment required (with options for taller, smaller, and cheaper players), swim workouts and puck handling drills for new and experienced players (that start out easy for adjustment to fins and slowly start to build up and strength and stamina do, as well as explanations of abbreviations commonly used within the sport), and links to other sites (for underwater hockey teams, equipment sellers, blogs, google and yahoo groups, and tournaments) throughout the site.<br />
  The graphics I want to include are some I’ve already designed, mock ups of strategies, pictures of plays (good and bad), equipment, demonstrations of techniques and, if possible, video of games and more advanced techniques of play. <br />
I want my color scheme to reflect the underwater theme of the sport by using an analogous color scheme based around a deep blue, along with deep purples and aquamarines. I will be using Helvetica as my text choice.</p>
